# Legal notice

**IEFP CRM** is an **independent, non-commercial, educational** project created by **Diogo du Valle** as a teaching tool for the training units **10868 - CRM Analytics** and **10870 - CRM Administration**.

## Trademark and logo

- "**IEFP**", "**Instituto do Emprego e Formação Profissional**" and its **logo** are property of **IEFP, I.P.** (the Portuguese public employment and vocational training institute). They are used here only in an **educational and identifying context**, to frame the material within the training units above.
- This project is **not official** and has **no affiliation, sponsorship or endorsement** from IEFP, I.P. It does not represent the Institute's position and is not an official service.

## Content and data

- All data shown in the application (clients, companies, proposals, etc.) is **fictional**, created only for demonstration and practice. It does not correspond to real people or entities.
- The application is intended for **training purposes** and is provided **"as is"**, without warranties of any kind.

## Class accounts

Anyone who merely visits the site or reads the manual **leaves nothing behind** - no record, no account, no cookies.

When a trainee **signs in to a class**, an account exists. From then on we store on the server, tied to that account:

| What | What for |
|---|---|
| Username, first and last name | Identifying who signs in and showing the name in the app |
| IEFP email and, if given, personal email | Sending the invitation, the submission receipt and password recovery |
| Password | Stored **hashed** (*bcrypt*); it is not readable, not even by us |
| **Profile photo, email signature, phone and job title** | Filling in the profile and the email signature. They follow the account, so they are not lost when changing computer |
| Backup of the work | One copy, replaced each time, so work is not lost |
| Submitted work | The submission the trainer assesses (at most two per trainee) |

- The **practice work** (clients, companies, proposals) lives in **each person's browser**. It only reaches the server in the backup and in the submission, and only the class trainer can read it.
- The **photo is personal data** and it is optional - without one you get initials. It is not shown in the class list: each person sees their own.
- **Deleting the account deletes all of this**, and deleting the class takes every account with it. It is immediate and no copy remains.
- None of this is used for anything other than the training. There is no advertising, no profiling and no sharing with third parties.

## Analytics

- To understand usage, we record **anonymous, aggregated statistics** (page visited, language, device type, videos played). We **do not use cookies**, **do not collect personal data** in this counting, and do not share with third parties - the data stays within the project's own infrastructure.

## Rights and contact

- Rights over trademarks, logos and other identified elements belong to their respective owners.
- If **IEFP, I.P.** (or any rights holder) considers that any element should be **changed or removed**, it will be handled promptly. Contact: **iefpcrm@cr0x.org**.
