# Customer service (Cases)

The **Cases** module handles customer support requests end to end: logging, conversation, deadlines (SLA) and satisfaction (CSAT/NPS). It covers UFCD 10866 - sales management and customer service.

## Open a case

**Cases → New case**. Fill in:

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Subject** | What the customer needs (required) |
| **Company** / **Contact** | Who the case relates to |
| **Channel** | Email, Phone, Chat, Portal or In person |
| **Priority** | Low, Medium, High or Urgent - sets the SLA deadline |
| **Owner** | Who handles the case (can be left unassigned) |
| **Description** | Becomes the **1st message** of the conversation |

!!! tip "Find a case"
    At the top of the list there is a **search bar**: type the **number** (e.g. `002`) or part of the **subject/company/contact** and the list filters instantly. It combines with the status filters.

## The case cycle

`New → In progress → Waiting → Resolved → Closed`

- Open the case from the list to see the **conversation**. Type in the reply box and **Reply** - each reply is kept in the history.
- Change the **status** with the buttons (New / In progress / Waiting).
- **Mark resolved** once the problem is handled.
- **Close with survey** asks for the customer's **CSAT** (1-5) and **NPS** (0-10).

## SLA (deadlines)

Each priority has a response deadline, with a traffic light:

| Priority | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Urgent | 1 day |
| High | 2 days |
| Medium | 4 days |
| Low | 7 days |

The badge shows **On time** (green), **SLA at risk** (1 day left) or **SLA breached** (deadline passed). The list sorts open cases by the most urgent deadline.

## Satisfaction (CSAT & NPS)

On closing, satisfaction is recorded:

- **CSAT** (Customer Satisfaction) - a **1 to 5** score for the service.
- **NPS** (Net Promoter Score) - **0 to 10**; the overall indicator runs from **-100 to +100** (promoters 9-10 minus detractors 0-6).

The **Analytics** screen summarises the **average CSAT**, the **NPS** and **SLA** compliance.

!!! tip "Where to see the summary"
    In **Analytics → Service satisfaction** and **Cases by status** you get the aggregated customer-service indicators.
